# Design Studio by Dheeraj Dasyam — Ultra Premium Website

## Prompt for Gemini / AI Generation

Create a fully functional, ultra-premium single-page website for **"Design Studio by Dheeraj Dasyam"** — an elite architecture, planning, interiors, and project management firm based in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, India. The website should embody an **anti-gravity IDE aesthetic** — a design language where elements feel weightless, floating, and dimensionally layered, as if the entire interface exists in zero gravity.

## Design Philosophy — Anti-Gravity IDE

### Core Aesthetic Principles:
1. **Zero-Gravity Floating Elements** — Cards, images, text blocks, and navigation elements should appear to float in 3D space with layered parallax depth. Use `transform: translateZ()`, perspective containers, and subtle hover-lift animations.
2. **Dark Void Background** — Deep charcoal-black (#0A0A0A) to obsidian (#111111) base with subtle noise grain texture overlay, creating an infinite void where elements suspend.
3. **Luminous Accent Lines** — Thin glowing lines (warm gold #C9A96E or champagne #D4AF7F) that trace architectural blueprints, connecting sections like invisible structural beams.
4. **Glassmorphism Panels** — Frosted glass cards with `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`, semi-transparent backgrounds (rgba(255,255,255,0.03)), and thin luminous borders.
5. **Magnetic Cursor Interactions** — Elements subtly gravitate toward the cursor on hover, as if pulled by an invisible force field.
6. **Staggered Reveal Animations** — Content enters from different axes (some rise up, some drift in from sides, some materialize from transparency) with orchestrated delays.
7. **Architectural Grid System** — Underlying golden-ratio grid with deliberate asymmetric breaks, mirroring architectural blueprint aesthetics.

### Typography:
- **Display / Headings:** "Cormorant Garamond" (weight 300-600) — elegant, architectural serif with extreme contrast
- **Sub-headings:** "Outfit" (weight 200-400) — geometric, modern, ultra-clean sans-serif
- **Body / Captions:** "DM Sans" (weight 300-400) — refined, readable, contemporary
- **Accent / Numbers:** "Space Mono" — monospaced, IDE-inspired, technical feel

### Color Palette:
```
--void-black: #0A0A0A;
--deep-charcoal: #111111;
--surface-dark: #1A1A1A;
--surface-glass: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03);

```html
<!-- Key structural approach -->
<body class="antigravity-void">
  <div class="grain-overlay"></div>
  <div class="grid-background"></div>
  <nav class="floating-nav"></nav>
  <main>
    <section class="hero antigravity-section"></section>
    <section class="about antigravity-section"></section>
    <section class="services antigravity-section"></section>

    <section class="contact antigravity-section"></section>
  </main>
  <footer class="floating-footer"></footer>
</body>
```

### Key CSS Techniques:
```css
/* Anti-gravity floating effect */
.float-element {
  animation: antigravity 6s ease-in-out infinite;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

@keyframes antigravity {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0px) rotateX(0deg); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-15px) rotateX(1deg); }
}

/* Glassmorphism cards */
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(201, 169, 110, 0.15);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 25px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}

/* Grain overlay */
.grain-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,..."); /* noise pattern */
  opacity: 0.04;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 9999;
}

/* Glowing border accent */
.glow-border {
  position: relative;
}
.glow-border::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0; left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, #C9A96E, transparent);
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
}
.glow-border:hover::before {
  opacity: 1;
}

/* Magnetic cursor effect (JS-driven) */
.magnetic {
  transition: transform 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
}
```

### JavaScript Features:
```javascript
// 1. Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
// 2. Magnetic cursor effect on floating cards
// 3. Parallax tilt effect on hero image (mousemove)
// 4. Smooth scroll with lerp
// 5. Counter animation for stats
// 6. Portfolio filter with FLIP animations
// 7. Preloader sequence
// 8. Nav background blur on scroll
```

### Google Fonts to Import:
```
Cormorant Garamond:wght@300;400;500;600
Outfit:wght@200;300;400;500
DM Sans:wght@300;400;500
Space Mono:wght@400;700
```

### External Resources:
- **GSAP** (optional, for complex animations): `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js`
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/ScrollTrigger.min.js`

---

## Responsive Breakpoints:
- **Desktop:** 1200px+ (full anti-gravity experience)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1199px (simplified floating, reduced parallax)
- **Mobile:** < 768px (stacked layout, floating effects reduced to subtle transforms, hamburger nav)

---

## Performance Considerations:
- Use `will-change: transform` sparingly on animated elements
- Lazy load portfolio images
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations for accessibility
- Optimize images with WebP format
- Use CSS containment (`contain: layout style paint`) on sections

---

## Summary

This website should feel like entering an architect's mind — a void where ideas float freely, structures materialize from nothing, and every element exists in a state of elegant suspension. The anti-gravity IDE aesthetic turns the conventional portfolio website into an immersive spatial experience that reflects the studio's design philosophy: bold, thoughtful, and boundary-defying.

**Key differentiator:** No other architecture studio website will look or feel like this. The anti-gravity floating elements, the dark void with luminous gold accents, the glassmorphism panels, and the magnetic cursor interactions create an experience that is as memorable as the buildings Dheeraj Dasyam designs.
